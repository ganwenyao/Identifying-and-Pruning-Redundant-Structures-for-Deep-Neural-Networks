# Identifying and Pruning Redundant Structures for Deep Neural Networks

## Dependencies
torch v1.0.1, torchvision

## Train baseline model

## Step 1: Normal training on the training set

## Step 2: Iterative pruning and fine-tuning (IPFT)

## Step 3: Normal training on both the training set and validation set
